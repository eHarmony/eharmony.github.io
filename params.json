{"name":"eHarmony Open Source Software Center","tagline":"","body":"# Welcome to eHarmony Open Source Software Repository\r\n\r\nHere are the projects that we have Open Sourced and their descriptions.\r\n\r\n# [Seeking] (https://github.com/eHarmony/seeking)\r\n\r\nSeeking is a library for generically building and executing type safe queries against different data stores.\r\n\r\nImplementations are currently available for:\r\n\r\n* Any relational database management system (RDBMS) supported by [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/)\r\n* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)\r\n* [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/)\r\n\r\nSeeking allows you to decouple your query building logic from data store APIs making it possible to switch between multiple different data stores without needing to recreate your queries.\r\n\r\n# [Benchmarkio] (https://github.com/eHarmony/benchmarkio)\r\n\r\nLibrary that contains common code for benchmarking different messaging brokers.\r\nIt was designed with idea in mind that it could be extended easily to add more broker implementations.\r\nIt uses A High Dynamic Range (HDR) Histogram for recording and analyzing data: https://github.com/HdrHistogram\r\n\r\nCurrently supports benchmarking of:\r\n* [Apache Kafka] (http://kafka.apache.org/)\r\n* [RabbitMQ] (https://www.rabbitmq.com/)\r\n* [ActiveMQ] (http://activemq.apache.org/)\r\n\r\n# [Aloha] (https://github.com/eHarmony/aloha)\r\n\r\nThe Aloha libraries provide implementations of machine learning models used at eHarmony.  The distinction between Aloha and other machine learning libraries such as [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/), [Torch](http://www.torch.ch/), [Mahout](http://mahout.apache.org/), etc, is that Aloha models:\r\n\r\n1. do not have predefined input and output types\r\n2. can be parsed by a single factory\r\n3. have external specifications (JSON)\r\n\r\n# What are we up to?\r\nWant to find out more about our work at eHarmony?
